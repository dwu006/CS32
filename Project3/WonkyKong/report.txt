1.
During each tick, the StudentWorld::move() method calls doSomething() on all the actors, including player and the goodie.
The doSomething() function checks if the goodie hasn't been picked up yet and also if the Player is on the same square or not by
using this function StudentWorld::isPlayerHere(). If they are on the same square we call GameWorld::increaseScore(value) function
which increase player score by 50 (extralife), 25 (garlic). Then it calls the kill() method of the goodie setting it to already picked up. 
Then we calls GameWorld::playSound(SOUND_GOT_GOODIE) which plays a sound to show the goodie has been collected. If goodie was extra life, 
then we call GameWorld::incLives() and inc lives by 1 and if it was garlic we call getWorld()->addPlayerBurps(), which calls addBurps() and 
adds 5 burps. For cleanup, it is deleted and removed from the game.

I dont know if its a computer problem or a code problem, but since I'm on linux when I compile and run my code,
my keybinds sometimes don't work for now reason. I add debugging code and it doesnt print.


3. 
I checked to see if a certain square is valid for movement or not through functions of checkFloor, checkLadder
I made the burps to delete any enemey (barrels, fireballs, and koopa)
